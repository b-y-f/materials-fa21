    "\n",
    "Welcome to Lab 8!\n",
    "\n",
    "In today's lab, we will learn about [the variability of sample means](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/5/Variability_of_the_Sample_Mean.html) as well as [the normal distribution](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/3/SD_and_the_Normal_Curve.html).\n",

    "**Lab Queue**: You can find the Lab Queue at [lab.data8.org](https://lab.data8.org/). Whenever you feel stuck or need some further clarification, add yourself to the queue to get help from a GSI or academic intern! Please list your name, breakout room number, and purpose on your ticket!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: If you are not attending lab, you have to complete this lab and submit by Wednesday, 11/03 before 8:59 A.M. PT in order to receive lab credit. Otherwise, please attend the lab you are enrolled in, get checked off with your GSI or academic intern **AND** submit this assignment by the end of the lab section (with whatever progress you've made) to receive lab credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission**: Once you're finished, scroll up to the top of the page, and run every cell in the notebook.  Select \"Save and Checkpoint\" in the File menu (please don’t hit Save As), then rerun the last cell of the notebook.  The result will contain a zip file that you can submit to Gradescope. If you are in lab, you can submit a ticket on lab.data8.org to ask a staff member to check you off. \n",
